                <h1>Angela Martin Supplier Relations</h1>
                <h3>In addition to heading the accounting department, Angela is also the former head of the Party Planning Committee and the office's Safety Officer. She is a constant source of complaints to Human Resources, although she retracts those lodged against Dwight Schrute at the onset of their secret romance. Angela lives with several cats, adores posters of infants posed as adults, and is a vegetarian and a singer. When she makes a mistake, Angela's first response is usually to shift the blame to someone else, along with an insult.</h3>
                <h3>Angela's petite size is a running gag of the show. Angela claims to weigh eighty-two pounds and wears a child's size ten ("Women's Appreciation"). In addition, because she finds the clothes at Gap Kids to sometimes be too "flashy", she occasionally shops at the American Girl store, buying items meant for "large colonial dolls". Michael has twice made fun of her stature, nicknaming her "Booster Seat" in reference to small children having to sit on one in restaurants.Angela drives a light brown first-generation Ford Focus sedan.he is a former child beauty pageant contestant and says that she enjoys being judged. She tends to list colors that she finds "whorish", including orange and green, that always seem to correspond to the color of clothes being worn by either Phyllis or Meredith. Angela bottles up her emotions to the point that, on occasion, she has private, emotional outbursts over relatively trivial matters. She also seems to be something of a conservative (albeit hypocritical) Christian. </h3>
