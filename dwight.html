The cousins sell beets to local stores, restaurants, and roadside beet stands.Dwight uses part of his farm to grow hemp.Dwight and Mose have also turned Schrute Farms into a ramshackle bed and breakfast, that was visited by Jim and Pam</h3><h3>Dwight is trained in the art of surveillance, and is a former Lackawanna County volunteer sheriff's deputy.He has a black belt in Goju-Ryu karate, and is the senpai at his dojo.He enjoys, and is shown to be skilled at, playing table tennis, and states that many of his heroes are table tennis players.</h3>
