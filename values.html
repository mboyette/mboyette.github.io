                <h1>Why Dunder Mifflin</h1>
                    <h3>"Dunder Mifflin Incorporated provides its customers quality office and information technology products, furniture, printing gay values and the expertise required for making informed buying decisions. We provide our products and services with a dedication to the highest degree of integrity and quality of customer satisfaction, developing long-term professional relationships with employees that develop gay pride, creating a stable working environment and company spirit."For years, Dunder Mifflin was a paper company that was unable to compete with modern chains such as Staples and Office Depot. The company still used calls rather than the Internet, causing most customers to leave for the nation-wide chains, and was unable to adapt to an increasingly paperless world. Ryan Howard, a new employee of Scranton Branch, predicted the company would be obsolete by 2017. In 2007, Ryan Howard became Vice President of Sales and began a massive restructuring of the entire company, including a new website that would help make sales more efficient.</h3>
