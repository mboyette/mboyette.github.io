                <h1>Andy Bernard</h1>
                <h3>Andy claims to have been born and raised in Simsbury, Connecticut.His birth name was Walter Bernard Jr., but after his younger brother was born, his parents decided that the new baby better embodied that name and should be named after his father instead. Thus, the original Walter was renamed Andrew, a name taken from a book of baby names. He claims to have been an obese child, though he never talks about it. It can be assumed that Andy's family was considerably wealthy growing up, as he admits that whenever anybody wanted something they would write it on a list for the housekeeper to get.Andy is a 1995 alumnus of Cornell University, which he often brags about to his peers, and minored in History. In a talking-head interview, he brags that he graduated in four years, having never studied once, been drunk the whole time, and sung in the a cappella group "Here Comes Treble", which he mentions often. Andy is descended from a well-heeled line of WASPs, that he claims "goes all the way back to Moses", and his family purportedly gained their wealth by transporting slaves.</h3>
                <h3>Andy was the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Dunder Mifflin Stamford branch. Andy worked with fellow salesmen Jim and Karen, under the direction of Josh Porter. Upon the branch's closure, Andy transferred to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. Despite this, he repeatedly proves himself to be a poor salesman, being one of the two worst salesmen in the office along with Pam Halpert.After she becomes office administrator, he is left the worst salesman, outsold even by the warehouse workers.</h3>
