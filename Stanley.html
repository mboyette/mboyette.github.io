                <h1>Stanley</h1>
                <h3>Stanley sits across from fellow employee, Phyllis Vance. Michael often refers to him as "Stanley the Manly". Stanley generally prefers working on crossword puzzles during the various staff meetings. Stanley's second wife, Teri (Joanne Carlsen), is white, a fact that confuses Michael (on separate occasions, at the Dundies and Phyllis' wedding, Michael has had to be told by an unamused Stanley that Teri is his spouse). He has two children from a previous marriage, including Melissa who visits the office on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.</h3>
