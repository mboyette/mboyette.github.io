                <h1>Toby Flenderson Human Relations </h1>
                <h3>In his childhood, Toby was forced to testify against both of his parents when the two got divorced. He attended Bishop O'Hara High School and is a Penn State University alumnus.Toby also has a B.S. in psychology from California Coastal College.</h3>
                <h3>Toby was in a seminary for a year but dropped out when he met his future wife. The two moved to Scranton and had a daughter named Sasha. They later divorced. Toby claims to have no "passion for HR" and was only hired at Dunder Mifflin as it was the first job he could find. He joins the others occasionally but only for business matters, such as reviewing the company's sexual harassment policy and mediating conflict between employees. Toby prefers to let angry employees vent to him, after which they feel better and the conflict eventually settles down and solves itself.Toby usually avoids office activities whenever possible and, like most of the staff, only tolerates Michael. He has reached out to Michael several times despite Michael's continued abuse. He gets along with the rest of the staff. </h3>
