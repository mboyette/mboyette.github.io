                <h1>Jim Halpert</h1>
                <h3>Jim Halpert was born on October 1, 1978, to Gerald and Betsy Halpert. He has two brothers; Pete, who lives in Boston, and Tom, who lives in New Jersey. They both share Jim's general love of pranks but have come across as unpleasant and they somewhat bully their little brother. Jim's parents presumably live in Scranton, as well as his sister Larissa and best friend Alan Murphy, who are listed as his emergency contacts at Dunder Mifflin. He also lists soft-shell crab as his favorite food.  </h3>
                <h3>Jim has noted that basketball "Was kind of [his] thing" in high school.Although no high school is specifically named by Jim, both Dunmore High School.Pam holds up his yearbook displaying their mascot name, Invaders, across the front) are referenced in separate episodes. In the Episode "Dwight's Speech," Jim tells Dwight that he majored in Public Speaking, however, he later denies this.Jim began working at Dunder Mifflin between 1998 and 1999.</h3>
