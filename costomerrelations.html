                <h1>Kelly Kapoor Customer Relations </h1>

                <h3>Born in 1980, Kelly is an Indian although she frequently makes incorrect statements about her heritage or religion. Her parents were brought together through an arranged marriage and she has three living sisters, as well as another who died.</h3><h3>She tends to engage in long-winded, one-sided conversations on relatively trivial subjects, often to the chagrin of Toby Flenderson, with whom she shares the annex, situated off the main office. Sometimes, it appears that Kelly plays dumb, as evidenced by a conspiratorial wink.Kelly is often in a severely dysfunctional on-again off-again relationship with fellow worker Ryan Howard. During a long break in their relationship, she dates Daryl Philbin.</h3>
