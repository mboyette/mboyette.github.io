                <h1>Creed Bratton Quality Assurance </h1>
                <h3>A product of the 1960s, Creed is older than all of the other employees at the office. Prior to joining Dunder Mifflin, he was most notably a member of the rock band The Grass Roots in the late 1960s.</h3>
                <h3>Creed was never actually hired, but walked in one day, and acted like he worked there and has been going in every day since then. He now serves as the quality assurance manager. Creed can be counted on to shirk nearly all responsibility, ranging from informal office duties such as spring cleaning to his primary job responsibilities.Outside of work, Creed teeters on the edge of homelessness and has professed his willingness to do whatever it takes to avoid becoming homeless again.He lives in Toronto, spending three nights a week there in order to milk the welfare state, and surreptitiously sleeps under his desk the remainder of the week.</h3>
