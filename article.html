			<h3>I will be discusing two of my favorite websites and one of the worst websites in 2019. I will also compare the two good websites to the one bad website. When comparing I will look at the difference in color, code, accesibility, and layout between the good and bad websites. My The first website I will talk about is apple, my second will be High School Sports in Mississippi, and my third website will be amazon.</h3> 
			<h3><a href="http://apple.com" target="_new">Apple </a>was created to show and sell apple products. Apple website has many links to other pages. One of which is there support page which is full of detail and extensive coding. I really like the colors and how simple home page is on this website. I have no idea how they coded in the search but its amaizing. All I have to do is type  what I am looking for or a questions and I have everyting I was looking for. I did find it interesting that the code is written in HTML with a really basic CSS. This was interesting because of how many moving parts it has.  On the CSS it was primarly focused on padding and margins where color and photos where coded into the HTML documment. I love that it fits the page no matter link. The code is really well writen and all aspects of the webpage functioning.  I found it interesting that the navigation is extreamly simple just an unordered list. Most pges even have two navigation one that navigates between pages and one between items. Over all the website font and color is the best parts. </h3>
			<h3> Now looking at <a href="http://hssportsms.com" target="_new"> High School Sports in Mississippi</a> you will notice it is all over the place. Just looking at the homepage you will see clashing colors and disorganization. The other pages are formated all the same with a distracting boarder full of colors. Next looking at the fonts and font colors they do not go together at all. Under the headers in the section there is a drop down arrow that says why this add I don't see a purpose for that being there. The boarder does not go down the complete section area. Also the border disapears when you shrink the window. This website is writen in HTML code with a indepth CSS style sheet. The website has a search in it but only allows you to search for adds not content. It took me a minute to figure out this website. It doesn't have a home tap in nav. Also the home page is basicly a navigation element and thats all. </h3>
			<h3> The last website that I looked at was <a href="http://amazon.com" target="_new"> Amazon </a>. Amazon is not as clean as apple's home page but is still well designed. Amazon's navigation is alot different then apple.It has two navigations one is a simple inline navigation the other has drop down navigations. When shrinking the page amizon does have a scroll bar on its homepage but not on it's other pages. Amazon is every ell disigned the colors and fonts do not clash and are apealing to the eye. Like apple amizon was written in HTML with a basic CSS. Amizon will well coded and very easy to use and follow. I think the fonts are my favorite because they are so well chosen for the theme of the page </h3> 
			<h3> Looking at the two good and one bad websites you will see that the two good have a lot in common. I choose to very popular websites since most people have seen one of them. Look at the difference in color of the websites I found that the two good websites both had apealing and light colors. The bad website started with harsh and distracting colors. Next looking at the code of each website I noticed that the two good had a very indeapth and complicated code where the bad website stuck to more of a basic code. Also with the good websites being an indepth style it was interesting that there were writen into the HTML with a basic CSS. Accesibility is a key factor if a website is good or not. I found that the good websites where easy to use and navigate around. Were the Bad website was not user friendly at all. Apple and amazon had a similar layout. The layout was simple and apealing to the eye. The bad website started with just a navigation no other content. When you went into each page the padding was horrendous. After looking at all three websites I now know that I will be focusing on the apearence along with the accessibilty. </h3>
