			<h3>I will be discussing two of my favorite websites and one of the worst websites in 2019. I will also compare the two good sites to the one bad website. When comparing, I will look at the difference in color, code, accessibility, and layout between the good and bad websites. The first website I will talk about is apple, my second will be High School Sports in Mississippi, and my third website will be amazon.</h3> 
            <h3><a href="http://apple.com" target="_new">Apple </a>was created to show and sell apple products. Apple's website has many links to other pages. One of which is there support page, which is full of detail and extensive coding. I like the colors and how simple home page is on this website. I have no idea how they coded in the search, but it is amazing. All I have to do is type what I am looking for or a question, and I have everything I was looking for. I did find it interesting that the code is written in HTML with a basic CSS. This was interesting because of how many moving parts it has.  On the CSS, it was primarily focused on padding and margins where color and photos were coded into the HTML document. I love that it fits the page no matter the link. The code is really well written and all aspects of the webpage functioning.  I found it interesting that the navigation is straightforward, just an unordered list. Most pages even have two navigation, one that navigates between pages and one between items. Overall the website font and color are the best parts. </h3>
            <h3> Now looking at <a href="http://hssportsms.com" target="_new"> High School Sports in Mississippi</a> you will notice it is all over the place. Just looking at the homepage, you will see clashing colors and disorganization. The other pages are formated all the same with a distracting border full of colors. Next, looking at the fonts and font colors, they do not go together at all. Under the headers in the section, there is a drop-down arrow that says why this add I don't see a purpose for that being there. The border does not go down the complete section area. Also, the border disappears when you shrink the window. This website is written in HTML code with an in-depth CSS style sheet. The website has a search in it but only allows you to search for adds, not content. It took me a minute to figure out this website. It doesn't have a home tap in nav. Also, the home page is a navigation element, and that's all. </h3>
            <h3> The last website that I looked at was <a href="http://amazon.com" target="_new"> Amazon </a>. Amazon is not as clean as apple's home page but is still well designed. Amazon's navigation is a lot different than an apple. It has two navigations one is simple inline navigation the other has to drop down navigations. When shrinking the page, amazon does have a scroll bar on its homepage but not on its other pages. Amazon is every ell designed the colors and fonts do not clash and are appealing to the eye. Like apple, amazon was written in HTML with a basic CSS. Amazon is a well-writen code and very easy to use and follow. I think the fonts are my favorite because they are so well chosen for the theme of the page. </h3> 
            <h3> Looking at the two good and one bad website you will see that the two good have a lot in common. I choose very popular websites since most people have seen one of them. Look at the difference in the color of the websites I found that the two good websites both had appealing and light colors. The bad website started with harsh and distracting colors. Next, looking at the code of each website, I noticed that the two good had a very in-depth and complicated code where the bad website stuck to more basic code. Also, with the good websites being an in-depth style, it was interesting that there were written into the HTML with a basic CSS. Accessibility is a key factor if a website is good or not. I found that a good website was easy to use and navigate around. Were the Bad website was not user friendly at all. Apple and Amazon had a similar layout. The layout was simple and appealing to the eye. The bad website started with just navigation, no other content. When you went into each page, the padding was horrendous. After looking at all three websites, I now know that I will be focusing on the appearance along with the accessibility. </h3>
